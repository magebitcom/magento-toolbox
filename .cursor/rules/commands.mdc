- Commands are located in src/command directory
- Commands must extend the [Command.ts](mdc:src/command/Command.ts) abstract class or any other class that inherits it
- New commands must be added to [index.ts](mdc:src/command/index.ts) file so that they are loaded. Commands also need to be added to [package.json](mdc:package.json) under contributes -> commands
- Commands that only generate files based on a pre-defined template can extend the [SimpleTemplateGeneratorCommand.ts](mdc:src/command/SimpleTemplateGeneratorCommand.ts) class
