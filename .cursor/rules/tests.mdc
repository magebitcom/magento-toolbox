- Tests are located in the src/test directory
- Utilities for tests can be found in this file [util.ts](mdc:src/test/util.ts)
- Some parts of the extension require the ExtensionContext to be present. To make sure it's set, tests should run the setup function from [setup.ts](mdc:src/test/setup.ts)
- Tests are written using Mocha framework (`mocha` package) in Typescript and must end with .test.ts file extension. Do NOT use `chai`
- Test spies, stubs and mocks can be written using the Sinon.js library
- Reference files for tests are stored in the test-resources directory
